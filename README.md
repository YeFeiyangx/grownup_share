## Growth Process Resource Introduction

There are many free courses about algorithm on the internet.(YouTube, BiliBili, Mooc, Coursera, etc.)

A lot of companies supply their API tutorials.(Google, FaceBook, Baidu, etc.)

E-books can easily obtain on the internet.(Deep Learning, Reinforce Learning, etc.)

## Basic Algorithms

Classical algorithm like graph, tree, greedy, sort and search. Include some basic scenarios like the shortest path and information retrieval.

- Graphtree;
- Shackhands;
- Recursion;
- Ergodic;
- Divide;
- Greedy;
- Dijkstra;
- Some helpful methods provided by Python.

## Reinforce Learning

Some basic RL examples will be given in this part which contains two implementation methods. One is to build the model completely. The others is with the help of APIs.(PaddleParl, GoogleAgents, etc.) And I will give some tips to tuning the models in my opinions. Thanks for original author's contributions.

- Examples from RL-An-Introduction-Master;
- PaddleParl tutorials;
  - DQN on-policy & off-policy
  - Gradient Policy
  - DDPG

## Optimization Tools

Here will provide basic tutorials by Google's software which suite for combinatorial optimization.(or-tools)

## Deep Learing

This part of learning was begging a long time ago. A lot of resources were not kept. Here will give a yolo-v4 model. More information will be attached in the future.

## LeetCode Examples

HuaWei Code Example

## Data Analysis

Provide some analysis examples used by nump, pandas and seaborn.

- Numps tutorials;
- Seaborn examples;
- Some analysis cases, like data exploring, data augmentation, etc..
