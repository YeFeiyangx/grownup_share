## Growth Process Resource Introduction

There are many free courses about algorithm on the internet.(YouTube, BiliBili, Mooc, Coursera, etc.)

A lot of companies supply their API tutorials.(Google, FaceBook, Baidu, etc.)

E-books can easily obtain on the internet.(Deep Learning, Reinforce Learning, etc.)

## Basic_Algorithms



*   A constraint programming solver;
*   A linear programming solver;
*   Wrappers around commercial and other open source solvers, including mixed
    integer solvers;
*   Bin packing and knapsack algorithms;
*   Algorithms for the Traveling Salesman Problem and Vehicle Routing Problem;
*   Graph algorithms (shortest paths, min cost flow, max flow, linear sum
    assignment).
